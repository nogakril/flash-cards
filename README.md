# German Flashcards ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

A custom flashcard app to help memorize **German vocabulary**.  
Iâ€™m currently learning German, and I've found that most vocabulary learning apps are either too expensive or overly complicated.
This project is my attempt to create a minimal, personalized flashcard system that I can extend as I go. 
Still in progress!

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Add and review German vocabulary words
- Practice with flashcards to test recall
- Focused design for personal learning goals
- Free and customizable (no subscriptions!)

---

 ## ðŸ“Š Word List (Google Sheet)
The app fetches vocabulary from this Google Sheet:  
ðŸ‘‰ [German Vocabulary Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v98WlHxJgd7oMsfra2cAD5KH_xFEmQdZXTEQIlKn3Uc/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

- To **add new words**, just edit the sheet.  
- Each row represents a word entry (e.g. German | English | Notes).  
- Changes will automatically be reflected in the app (next reload).

> If you want your own version, make a copy of the sheet (`File > Make a copy`) and update the sheet ID in the app code.
