# German Flashcards ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

A custom flashcard app to help memorize **German vocabulary**.  
Iâ€™m currently learning German, and I've found that most vocabulary learning apps are either too expensive or overly complicated.
This project is my attempt to create a minimal, personalized flashcard system that I can extend as I go. 
Still in progress!
